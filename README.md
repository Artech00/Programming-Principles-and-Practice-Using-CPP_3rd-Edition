### 🚀 **Advanced Study Plan (Based on 656 Pages)**  
- **📆 Duration:**  **3-4 weeks (~25 days)**
- **📖 Pages per day:** **25-40 pages**  
- **💻 Coding:** **50% of study time should be hands-on coding.**  
- **🔁 Review System:** **Daily recaps + weekly mini-projects.**  

## **🪧Key Information**  
- There is a folder called `book` where the PDF version of the book is located
- Each project directory (e.g., `week1/day1/`) includes a file named **`words_notes.md`**, which contains the main notes written for the current day.  
- Within the same directory, there is a **`codes`** folder (e.g., `week1/day1/codes`) that holds code examples written for that day.

## Opening Project Markdown Files(`.md files`) in Obsidian(note-taking app)

For the best experience when viewing and editing current project's Markdown files (organized in directories like `week1/day1/filename.md`), I recommend using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking app.

### Steps to Open a .md File in Obsidian

1. **Download Obsidian:**  
   - Visit the [Obsidian Download Page](https://obsidian.md/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Obsidian:**  
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. **Create or Open a Vault:**  
   - Launch Obsidian.
   - Choose to create a new vault or open an existing one.
   - In our case to work with your project files, select **"Open folder as vault"**.
   - Navigate to the folder containing your files (e.g., the directory `week1/day1/`).
   - Click **"Select Folder"** to open the vault, that's it!
